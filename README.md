This is the Github repository for my Capstone project for the [IBM Data Science Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). The project aims to create a explore data and create 
a classfication model to predict launches for SpaceX's Falcon 9 stage 1 booster. This data can be used by a SpaceX competitor to optimise costs, which would help them in competitive bidding to acquire business.

The project is mainly divided into the data acquisition, data wrangling, visualisation and exploration and predictive stages. The notebooks and files for the stages are as follows:

- [Data Collection via API](https://github.com/sukanto-m/Capstone/blob/master/jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb)
- [Data Collection via web scraping](https://github.com/sukanto-m/Capstone/blob/master/jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb)
- [Data wrangling](https://github.com/sukanto-m/Capstone/blob/master/labs-jupyter-spacex-Data%20wrangling.ipynb)
- [Data visualisation](https://github.com/sukanto-m/Capstone/blob/master/labs-jupyter-spacex-Data%20wrangling.ipynb)
- [Data exploration via SQL](https://github.com/sukanto-m/Capstone/blob/master/jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb)
- [Data dashboard](https://github.com/sukanto-m/Capstone/blob/master/spacex_dash_app.py)
- [Launch site visualisation on Folium](https://github.com/sukanto-m/Capstone/blob/master/lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.ipynb)
- [Predictive modelling](https://github.com/sukanto-m/Capstone/blob/master/SpaceX_Machine%20Learning%20Prediction_Part_5.ipynb)


  Each of these files explores and drills down on the data to analyse various factors like payload mass, launch sites etc which may or may not influence the launch outcome (failure or success). The findings are explained in detail
  in the project presentation.

  Thank you.
